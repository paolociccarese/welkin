<h1>Welkin</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Welkin is a graph-based <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>
visualizer.</p>
<h2>Technology and Requirements</h2>
<p>Welkin can be used both as a standalone application or as an applet. 
It's written in Java that depends on the following libraries for operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena</a> as the RDF
support library (parsing, storing, querying)</li>
</ul>
<p>and it has the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java 1.4</a> or later
compatible virtual machine for your operating
system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ok, I'm interested, now what?</h2>
<p>The best place to start is the Welkin <a href="guide.html">user
guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Where do I download it?</h2>
<p>You can obtain Longwell in two different ways:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>download a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/dist/welkin/">prepackaged
distribution</a><br>
  </li>
  <li>download the files directly from the code repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you want to download the files from the repository (for
example, if you want to have the latest and greatest development
snapshot), you need to have a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
client installed. At this point, just type</p>
<pre>svn co http://simile.mit.edu/repository/welkin/trunk/ welkin</pre>
<p>at the command line and the latest welkin distribution will appear
in the "welkin" directory.</p>
