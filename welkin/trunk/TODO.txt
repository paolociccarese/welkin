                          +--------------------------------------+

known bugs/limitations
======================

 - the ontology tree should only display items that will make the graph change if acted upon

 - the 'welkin' button does nothing, it should display an About dialog for credits, licensing
   info and the like.

 - the WebStart jnlp file doesn't work, need to understand how to automate the jar-signing
   procedure

 - there are no documents, but we'll wait until there is a little stability in both the
   UI and the features before writing some

 - need to find a cool icon/logo for both the window and the mac application

 - the graph distribution widgets should be updated when the graph changes


in the queue (and in no particular order)
=========================================

 - avoid using the jena model but try to load the RDF directly from the parsers in 
   stream mode, this should reduce the memory consumption.
 
 - allow loading of N3 files

 - add provenance info to the graph model

 - implement highlight by literal token match and by URI token match

 - allow to restrict the graph acting upon the graph distribution widgets, for example, by
   showing only the nodes that belong to a particular range of the distribution. This might
   require some more clever caching of the results in order to act on the graph
   responsively.
